<h1>Marinated Boneless, Skinless Smoked Chicken Thighs</h1>
<img src="../images/smoked-chiken.jpg" alt="smoked chicken">
<p>Smoky and slightly spicy chicken thighs with a tender and moist interior.
   The type of hot honey used will have a big impact on how spicy your thighs
    are; the extra-hot honey has a kick to it. The chicken thighs have a thin
     smoke ring with a deep mahogany color on the surface of the thighs thanks
      to the marinade and smoke. Great on a biscuit with extra-hot honey or on
       a buttered and toasted brioche bun.</p>
       <h2>the ingredientes</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>

       <h2>directions</h2>
       <ol>
         <li> Whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, hot honey,
         shallot, garlic, and chili powder in a medium bowl.
          Combine hot honey mixture and chicken thighs in a
           gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Seal bag and
            gently massage to work marinade into thighs. Chill
             in a refrigerator, at least 2 hours, or up to 8 hours.</li>
             <li>Prepare a smoker according to manufacturer's
               instructions, bringing internal temperature to 225 
               to 250 degrees F (107 to 120 degrees C); maintain
                temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove chicken
                 thighs from marinade, and pat dry with paper towels; 
                 do not discard marinade.</li>
             <li>Stir together cornstarch and water in a small metal bowl until combined.</li>
             <li>Strain marinade through a fine-mesh strainer into a small saucepan;
               whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring marinade mixture to a boil over 
               medium heat, whisking frequently. Reduce heat to low and cook, 
               whisking occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes.
                Set sauce aside to cool at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle chicken thighs evenly with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Smoke chicken thighs, maintaining temperature inside smoker,
                   until a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion registers\
                    165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours,
                     brushing chicken thighs with reserved sauce every 15 minutes 
                     after the first hour of smoking. Transfer chicken thighs to 
                     a plate or platter and serve immediately.</li>
